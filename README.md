# 🔐 Cryptify

**Cryptify** is a simple encryption and decryption tool based on the classic **Caesar Cipher** algorithm.  
It supports both encrypting and decrypting messages using a shift key.

## 📚 What is Caesar Cipher?

The **Caesar Cipher** is a basic encryption technique where each letter in the message is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.  
For example, shifting `'A'` by 3 gives `'D'`. Decryption reverses this shift to recover the original text.
